## FAQ

#### Can we already play the game?

#### What can I do with the NFT? Can I get more than one?

_The NFT is purely a collectible for early adopters._
_You can trade this NFT on an external marketplace like <ExternalLink href="https://paras.id/">Paras</ExternalLink>._
_There is a 10% royalty attached to the NFT, which means a portion of all sales will flow directly to our DAO treasury._
_We will use royalties for funding of the project._
_We might add utility later to these NFTs, but we don't yet want to make any promises._

#### Why did you decide to build a blockchain game?

_Blockchain gaming is a very new topic, but it's emerging right now._
_There have been very succesfull blockchain games like <ExternalLink href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</ExternalLink>_
_, which use a mechanism called <ExternalLink href="https://www.playtoearn.online/whats-the-play-to-earn-business-model/">play to earn</ExternalLink>._
_To explain it briefly, play to earn rewards players by giving them tokens, which are stored on the blockchain._
_The game can do that, because a token is basically just a value stored on the blockchain._
_A Smart Contract would be called that can alter the state on the chain and generate tokens for a specific wallet address._
_The user who owns that wallet can then swap his tokens for other cryptocurrencies or he can move them to a centralized exchange and sell them for real money._

_The token given by the play to earn game has value depending on its usage._
_Most tokens are required in the game to unlock or buy several things._
_It is really just an in-game currency, which is instead stored on a blockchain._
_This results in a massive shift, that many call true ownership._
_What it allows you is to transfer your game currency and do whatever you want with it._
_It is no longer stored on the game servers and the game allows you to show your balance, but it's the other way around._
_The user gives allowance to the app to access his wallet to check the balance._

_Simply put, play to earn connects an in-game economy to the real world economy._
_The concept fascinated my this much, that I decided to launch my own blockchain gaming project._
